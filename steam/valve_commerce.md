Company shall submit the Applications to Steam for release no later than the first commercial release of each Application or Localized Version, or, if already commercially released as of the Effective Date, within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date.  Thereafter, Company shall submit to Steam any Localized Versions and Application Updates (in beta and final form) when available, but in no event later than they are provided to any other third party for commercial release.  Company shall provide these copies in object code form, in whatever format Valve reasonably requests. 

 

2.2       Steam Compatibility.  Company shall make the Applications compatible with Steam and any Steamworks services that Company may choose to use.  Company shall, in cooperation with Valve, use reasonable efforts to maintain compatibility of the Applications with future versions of Steam. 

 

2.3       QA.  Company shall perform quality assurance and other error testing of the Applications (including any Localized Versions and all Application Updates and other deliverables delivered pursuant to Section 5.2), consistent with industry standards, prior to its delivery of final versions of each to Valve.

 

2.4      DLC.  If Company distributes the Application through any other (non-Steam) distribution channel, and if Company distributes any material DLC for the Application through that other channel, it will deliver the DLC to Valve at the same time such that Steam Account Owners will receive comparable DLC with customers acquiring the Application through other channels.  Company is free to offer special and unique promotional content through other distribution channels, provided that material parity is maintained between Steam Account Owners and users of other distribution channels who make a comparable investment in the Application and the associated DLC. 

 

2.5       No Other In-Application Stores. The parties agree that Applications distributed via Steam will not include functionality from or links or references to any store other than Steam, or any other facility for making purchases or payments.  For clarification, the preceding sentence does not apply to versions of Applications that are distributed outside of Steam (whether at brick-and-mortar retail stores or online), whether or not such versions use Steamworks.

 

2.6       Application Items and/or Currency.  To the extent any Application supports the sale of digital items or digital currency for use in the Application, Company shall not allow or facilitate the redemption or exchange of such digital items or digital currency for real-world currency.

 

2.7       User Reviews.  Company shall not artificially manipulate the user review system for Applications.  For example, Company may not solicit reviews in exchange for anything of value, with a single exception that Company may provide a free copy of the Application to bona fide press or reviewers (who may be required to disclose the gift). 

 

2.8.        Open Source Software.  Company shall not distribute via Steam, or combine any Valve materials with, open source or other software that is licensed under terms that purport to bind Valve to contractual obligations (e.g. the GNU General Public License or Lesser General Public License), without prior discussion with and separate written agreement from Valve.

 

 

3.         LICENSES; OWNERSHIP.

 

3.1       License for Valve to Use the Applications.  Company hereby grants to Valve a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to internally reproduce, use and modify the Applications in object code format for general access and as necessary to (a) enable the use and distribution of the Applications (including Demo Versions, Localized Versions and Application Updates) via Steam as described in Section 3.2, (b) support Steam Account Owners in the use of Steam accounts as described in Section 5.1, and (c) support Steam Account Owners as described in Section 5.3 in the event Company fails to fulfill its obligations under Section 5.3. 

 

3.2       Electronic Delivery License.  Company hereby grants to Valve a non-exclusive license to reproduce, publicly display and perform, transmit, sell, license and otherwise distribute the Applications in object code form via Steam and through any type of payment method to Steam Account Owners in the Territory.  To the extent that the Agreement includes versions of an Application for multiple operating systems (e.g. a Windows version, a Linux version and an Apple OS version) such versions shall be sold together as a single "hybrid" Application unit on Steam.  Therefore, an Apple OS version of any Application, a Linux version of an Application, and a Windows version of an Application shall not be considered to be separate sales when calculating the payment obligations pursuant to Section 6.  In the case of Demo Versions available outside of Steam, if any, if such a Demo Version includes a reference to how/where to purchase the Application (e.g., screens on start or exit), Company shall cooperate with Valve to include a reference to Steam in that location. 

 

3.3       License for Company to Use Valve Trademarks.  Valve hereby grants to Company a royalty-free, fully paid up license, during the Term, to use, publicly display and perform, reproduce, and distribute Valve's trademarks, including logos set forth in, and in accordance with, Valve's Branding Guidelines, the current version of which can be accessed at https://partner.steamgames.com/documentation/branding (the "Steam Marks"), on packaging for or at the site of distribution of a Steam-enabled version of the Application outside of Steam, and in marketing and promotional materials for the Application.  Valve shall have the right to review and approve any particular use of the Steam Marks prior to that use, provided that (a) such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (b) any previously approved use shall not require a new approval merely because the Steam Mark is being used in the form approved in connection with translated versions of the same materials for which that prior approval was obtained.

 

3.4       Trademark and Copyright License for Applications Marketing.  Company hereby grants to Valve a worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free license, during the Term, to use, publicly display and perform, reproduce, distribute and display the trademarks, including logos, used for the Applications, materials from the Applications (e.g., screenshots, movies, etc.), marketing material and Ratings Information (the "Company Marks") as part of or in connection with promotion, marketing, licensing or sale of the Applications. 

 

3.5       Ownership; Reservation of Rights.  Except as expressly provided herein, Company retains all right, title and interest in and to the Applications and the Company Marks, and Valve retains all right, title and interest in and to Steam, the Steam Marks, and Sales Data.  All rights not expressly granted hereby are reserved by each of the Parties.

 

3.6       Territory Restrictions.  Any Territory restrictions, if any, shall apply to the sale or initial distribution of the Application.  Company acknowledges and agrees that, since Steam Account Owners can access their accounts from anywhere, Steam Account Owners may receive subsequent distributions of Applications from places outside the Territory.  In addition, Company agrees that the display of Company Marks on a Valve or Steam website in a manner intended primarily to reach prospective Steam Account Owners in the Territory shall be considered permissible use of the Marks even though such Marks are capable of being viewed by Steam Account Owners outside the Territory. 

 

 

4.         MARKETING; PUBLICITY AND SALES DATA.

 

4.1       Valve Marketing.  Valve may, at its own expense and sole discretion, market and promote the Applications via Steam and the Steam web site located at store.steampowered.com ("Steam Website") and other channels.  Valve shall be entitled to release the Application(s) day and date with the first release of the Application(s) in any other distribution channel. 

 

4.2       Press Release.  Valve and Company may reference in public statements the fact that the Applications are or will be available on Steam; however, any press release about the other Party shall be subject to the prior approval of the other Party.

 

4.3       Application Sales Data.  Subject to Valve's privacy policy, the Steam Subscriber Agreement, applicable laws and any other third party confidentiality obligations, Valve will provide Company with Sales Data for the Applications.  Valve agrees to provide access to a web site containing the Sales Data. 

 

4.4       Ratings Information.  Company agrees to provide, and to keep up-to-date, any applicable ratings information obtained from ratings or government authorities (including, without limitation, The Entertainment Software Rating Board) ("Ratings Information"). Valve will provide Company with an online tool to facilitate the embedding of Ratings Information in the Steam Website.

 

4.5       Press Accounts.  As soon as an Application is released on Steam, Valve may add the Application to its press subscription accounts, such that these industry and general interest journalists may access the Application free-of-charge in order to evaluate, and potentially review, the Application. 

 

4.6       Compatibility and Performance Test Accounts.  As soon as Company submits an Application for release on Steam, Valve may add, at no cost and without any payment due to any third party, the Application to select third-party accounts for their use in providing hardware and software compatibility and performance testing in connection with Steam, but only so long as Valve provides its own games to such accounts.

 

 

5.         SUPPORT.

 

5.1       Valve Support to Steam Account Owners.  Subject to Company's compliance with Section 5.2, Valve will provide support for Steam account and Steam billing problems encountered by Steam Account Owners. Valve will provide this support at the same level that Valve provides customer support to customers of third-party products that Valve distributes via Steam. 

 

5.2       Company Support to Valve.  Company shall provide Valve with the following support for the Applications: (a) deliver all Application Updates, in object code form, made to the Applications, in beta and final forms, when available but in no event later than they are provided to any other third party; (b) promptly correct all material errors or defects in the Applications reported by Valve and deliver such corrections to Valve in object code form in a timely fashion; (c) provide such other reasonable additional support as Valve may reasonably request in order to maintain compatibility of the Applications with Steam and, if applicable, with any Steamworks services used by the Application; and (d) promptly respond to Valve's questions regarding the Applications.  Upon delivery to Valve of final versions of any corrections and enhancements or other deliverables under this Section, those materials shall be deemed to be part of the Applications.

 

5.3       Company End User Support.  Company will provide support to Steam Account Owners who have acquired a copy of the Applications, including but not limited to general questions concerning use of the Applications and assisting customers in the diagnosis and correction of problems encountered in using the Applications.  Company will provide such support at the same level that Company provides customer support for other applications developed and/or distributed by or for Company.

 

5.4       Use of Partner Site and Tools.  Valve makes a Partner portal and related tools available to Company to assist in submitting and viewing information relevant to its Applications.  Company will ensure that any password needed to access this site is treated as Confidential Information, and agrees that it will be responsible for any use that is made of that password.

 

 

6.         REVENUE SHARE.

 

6.1       Payment.  Beginning on the date Valve first receives gross revenue from the sale of any Applications over Steam, within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month, Valve shall provide a report of gross revenue, adjustments made in calculating Adjusted Gross Revenue, and a report of the payment amount owed, for such month, and pay to Company seventy percent (70%) of the Adjusted Gross Revenue actually received by Valve from Valve's exploitation of each of the Applications pursuant to Section 3.2 during the such calendar month, except that revenue related to Workshop Contributions and game fees from Community Market sales will be paid in accordance with Sections 6.3 and 6.4 below.  Monthly statements will also report revenues and adjustments by Primary Platform, where applicable.  For purposes of such reporting, the "Primary Platform" is the operating system on which the majority of usage occurred during the seven day period following the date of purchase (if no usage occurred during that period, the Primary Platform shall be the operating system on which the Steam Account Owner purchased the Application).  Payments under this Section will only be paid with respect to the version of the Application running on the Primary Platform.  To the extent that the payment calculation results in a negative amount, that negative amount will be carried forward and deducted from any future amounts otherwise payable by Valve hereunder.

 

6.2       Withholding Tax.  If, pursuant to the applicable tax law, a withholding tax is or reasonably could be imposed on Valve's payments to Company as reasonably determined by Valve in good faith, then Valve may deduct from such payments the appropriate amount of withholding taxes that are required to be withheld according to applicable law and remit such withholding to the relevant taxing authority as reasonably determined by Valve in good faith.  Valve shall indicate the amount of withholding, if any, in any statement or along with any payment hereunder and deliver to Company upon request any withholding tax certificate or other evidence of payment received from the relevant tax authorities.  Upon request, Valve agrees to take reasonable measures to cooperate in minimizing any such withholding or other applicable tax.  Company and Valve shall cooperate with each other in regard to filing and maintaining any tax documents necessary to collect, remit, and/or reduce such withholding, including but not limited to the United States Internal Revenue Service form W-8 BEN (or its equivalent) and appropriate supporting documents.

 

6.3       Special Provisions Regarding Workshop Contributions.  Company may decide to have an Application support Workshop.  If any Company Applications are Workshop-enabled Applications, this Section 6.3 will apply.

 

6.3.1    License to Workshop Contributions.  Workshop Contributions are not Applications or DLC.  However, the licenses in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 apply to any Company content that is incorporated into a Workshop Contribution. 

 

6.3.2    Sharing of Revenues from Workshop Contribution Sales.  Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, and notwithstanding Section 6.1, Valve will pay Company a share of Adjusted Gross Revenues derived from any sales of Workshop Contributions that occur on a Workshop page specific to a Company Application or within a Company Application.  Unless a different revenue-sharing arrangement is agreed to by the parties, Company's revenue share shall be equal to seventy percent (70%) of Adjusted Gross Revenues, less a percentage to be paid to the contributor(s) that submitted the Workshop Contribution ("Contributor").  Valve may provide Company with the means to set or change the percentage paid to Contributors, and/or the allocation of the contributor percentage amongst contributors in cases of bundled item sales.  If no percentage is specified by Company, the default percentage shall be twenty-five percent (25%) of Adjusted Gross Revenues.

 

6.3.3    Sales of Workshop Contributions Through Third-party Workshops.  Some Workshop-enabled Applications permit (or do not prohibit) the sale of Workshop Contributions through Steam Workshop pages other than the Workshop page that is specifically set up for that Application.  Unless otherwise agreed, Valve has no obligation to pay Company any revenue share from sales of Workshop Contributions through Workshops other than the Workshop specifically set up for the Company Application.   

 

6.4       Special Provisions Regarding Community Market Sales.  Company may decide to have an Application support the Steam Community Market such that virtual items derived from the Application can be sold in the Community Market.  If an Application supports the Steam Community Market, this Section 6.4 will apply.

 

6.4.1    Transaction and Game Fees.  Valve charges a "transaction fee" for each sale made in a community market, which is typically equal to five percent (5%) of the amount paid for the item sold (although Valve may adjust this transaction fee in its sole discretion).  The "transaction fee," and the sales proceeds received by the seller in connection with the sale of a virtual item, are excluded from Adjusted Gross Revenues.  In addition to the "transaction fee," a "game fee" may be assessed for each sale made in a community market.  Valve may provide Company with the ability to set or change the "game fee" percentage.  If Company does not specify a different "game fee" percentage, the default percentage shall be ten percent (10%).

 

6.4.2    Sharing of Game Fee Revenues. Valve will share the "game fee" net of Applicable Adjustments (the "Net Game Fee") with Company.  Unless a different revenue-sharing arrangement is agreed to by the parties, Company's share of the Net Game Fee will be equal to seventy percent (70%), except that, if the item sold is a Workshop Contribution, the Net Game Fee will be equal to seventy percent less a percentage to be paid to the original Contributor(s) of the Workshop Contribution.  Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, the percentage to the Game Fee to be paid to the Contributor(s) will be the same percentage of Adjusted Gross Revenues from the original sale of that Workshop Contribution that was paid to such Contributor(s), as described in Section 6.3.2 above.     

 

6.5       Minimum Monthly Payment.  In the event amounts due to Company for a given month do not exceed one hundred dollars (US$100), Valve may elect not to remit payment for that month, and to accumulate payments due until they exceed one hundred dollars (US$100) at the time of a future monthly payment cycle. 

 

6.6       Additional Revenue Share.  If an Application generates total Adjusted Gross Revenue in excess of ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00) after October 1, 2018, Valve will pay Company an additional five percent (5%) of the Adjusted Gross Revenue in excess of ten million dollars (US$10,000,000.00) actually received by Valve from Valve's exploitation of that Application pursuant to Section 3.2.  If an Application generates total Adjusted Gross Revenue in excess of fifty million dollars (US$50,000,000.00) after October 1, 2018, Valve will pay Company an additional five percent (5%) of the Adjusted Gross Revenue in excess of fifty million dollars (US$50,000,000.00) actually received by Valve from Valve's exploitation of that Application pursuant to Section 3.2.  If the total Adjusted Gross Revenue for an Application drops below the thresholds listed above due to refunds, chargebacks, or otherwise, Valve may deduct the amounts previously paid under this Section from any future amounts otherwise payable by Valve under this Agreement.  Revenue generated through a current or future version of Steam operated for the People's Republic of China in cooperation with a domestic Chinese company will not count towards Adjusted Gross Revenue for the purposes of this section.  Company agrees to use good faith in pricing and bundles to allocate revenue to Applications proportionate to their end-user value.  If Valve determines in good faith that Company has manipulated Adjusted Gross Revenue from one or more other Applications to qualify another Application for additional revenue under this Section 6.6, Valve may properly allocate the Adjusted Gross Revenue to the appropriate Applications, in its sole discretion, and reserves the right to cease selling Company's Applications and/or terminate the Agreement. 

 

7.         TERM.

 

7.1       Term.  This Agreement shall become effective as of the Effective Date and continue until terminated in accordance with this Agreement. 

 

7.2       Termination by Either Party for Cause.  Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice at any time if the other Party is in material breach of any warranty, term or condition of this Agreement and has failed to cure that breach within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof, or the other Party experiences an Event of Default.  "Event of Default" means any of the following events:  (a) a Party becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts as they mature, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (b) a petition under any foreign, state or United States federal bankruptcy act, receivership statute, or the like, as they now exist, or as they may be amended, is filed by a Party; or (c) such a petition is filed by any third party, or an involuntary petition is not resolved favorably to such Party within sixty (60) days after the petition is filed.

 

7.3       Termination for Convenience.  Either Party may terminate the Agreement for convenience at any time after expiration of the Initial Term, without cause, by providing the other Party with thirty (30) days prior written notice of such termination.  "Initial Term" means the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending one (1) year after the last Application to release on Steam under this Agreement was so released.

 

7.4       Survival.  Sections 3.1, 3.5,  5.5, 6, 7.4, and 8 - 15, and any then-existing Steam Account Owner licenses to Applications, shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.  Sections 3.2 and 5.2 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement, but in each case only with respect to supporting Steam Account Owners that have licensed an Application prior to termination or expiration. In addition, upon termination of this Agreement, Company hereby grants to Valve a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid-up license to use, reproduce, transmit and distribute the Applications and any error corrections in object code form via electronic delivery solely to Steam Account Owners that have licensed a Valve distributed version of the Applications prior to the date of any termination of this Agreement, and Company will continue to give Steam Account Owners access to online features of the Application on an equal, non-discriminatory basis with other users, for so long as Company supports such online features.

11.1     Scope of Steamworks services.  This Section 11 applies in case Company chooses to use any Steamworks services.

 

11.2     License for Company to Use Steamworks SDK.  Valve hereby grants to Company (a) a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license to use and reproduce the Steamworks SDK internally, solely for the purpose of evaluating, testing and adding Steamworks for use by Steam Account Owners of the Applications; and (b) a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license to distribute to its end users, in object code form, the Steam Installer and the Steamworks Redistributable Code.  Company must comply with Section 2.8 in the implementation of Steamworks features. 

 

11.3     Provision of Network Support for Steamworks Services.  Valve will use reasonable efforts to provide network support via Steam for the Steamworks services, for Steam Account Owners, in substantially the same manner in which they are provided for Valve's own games.  Company understands that network support may be unavailable due to routine maintenance and unplanned interruptions due to hardware, software and/or Internet failures.  Valve's obligations under this Section 11.3 are conditioned upon Company continually performing all tasks necessary, as directed by Valve, to ensure the Applications are compatible with Steam, the Steam Installer and Steamworks. Valve may make changes to, add services to, or remove services from Steamworks in its sole discretion, provided that Valve shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any such changes are backwardly compatible with any Applications that were made commercially available to end users and that incorporated earlier versions of Steamworks features prior to such change.

 

11.4     Steamworks Product Keys.  Prior to manufacturing or reproducing (or having manufactured or reproduced) any copies of Applications that use Steamworks for distribution outside of Steam, including any pre-release copies made available as part of a beta program, Company shall request Steamworks Product Keys from Valve for distribution with such copies and Company shall include such Steamworks Product Key(s) with each copy of the Applications in accordance with instructions provided by Valve.  Additionally, for any copies of Applications that use Steamworks, Company shall include the Steam client with those copies in accordance with instructions provided by Valve.  Company hereby acknowledges that a Steamworks version of the Application requires a Steamworks Product Key and that Valve uses authentication software such that an end user must have a valid Steamworks Product Key and authenticate such Steamworks Product Key via the Internet to use the Steamworks version of the Application.

 

11.5     Revenue Share Inapplicable to non-Steam Distributions.  For the sake of clarity, the revenue share obligations set forth in Section 6 (Revenue Share) of the Agreement do not apply to distributions of Applications by Company through distribution channels other than Steam. 

 

11.6     Notice to End Users Regarding Steam Account Requirement.  In any distribution of a Steam-enabled version of the Application through a distribution channel other than Steam, Company will include a prominent notice to end users that a Steam account is required for use.  Valve shall have the right to review and approve any such form of notice prior to distribution, provided that any previously approved form of notice shall not require a new approval merely because the notice is being used in the form approved in connection with translated versions of the same Application.

 

11.7     Termination of Steamworks Services.  If Company elects to use any Steamworks services ("Steamworks Services"), Valve's provision of Steamworks Services may be terminated for cause on the same terms as the Agreement as a whole may be terminated for cause.  Valve may terminate Steamworks Services without cause, for any particular Application, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice only after the expiration of the Initial Term for the applicable Application.  Either Party may terminate the Agreement without terminating the Steamworks Services, in which case Valve will continue to provide the Steamworks Services until a Party expressly terminates the Steamworks Services, and the terms of the Agreement shall survive such termination and continue to apply for the purposes of the continuation of the Steamworks Services.  Moreover, Valve may terminate the Steamworks Services without terminating the Agreement, in which case such termination will only affect the additional rights and obligations set forth in this Section 11   it shall not, in and of itself, terminate or otherwise effect the Agreement as a whole. 

 

11.8     Effect of Termination of Steamworks Services - Survival of Certain Rights and Services. 

 

            11.8.1  If Company has commercially distributed a Steamworks version of an Application outside of Steam prior to any termination of this the Steamworks Services with respect to that Application, then termination of the Steamworks Services without cause shall not affect Company's rights under Section 11.2, which rights shall survive such termination.  Valve shall have the right, however, to terminate such license immediately upon notice if any claim that the Steamworks SDK infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party is partially or fully adjudicated against Valve. 

 

            11.8.2  For as long as Valve distributes and maintains certain Steamworks features and services for its own games, Valve shall continue to provide network support for such Steamworks features and services in accordance with Section 11.3 for the version of each Application that was current at the time of termination (the "Then-Current Version").  The licenses set forth in Sections 3.1 (License for Valve to Use the Applications), 3.2 (Electronic Delivery License) and 3.4 (Trademark and Copyright Licenses for Applications Marketing) of the Agreement shall survive termination for this purpose.

 

            11.8.3  For as long as the Application utilizes Steamworks, Company shall continue to provide support to end users and to Valve as set forth in Section 5.2 (Company Support to Valve) and 5.3 (Company End User Support), for the Then-Current Version.

 

           11.8.4  In the event Valve terminates Company's license under Section 11.2, unless Valve instructs otherwise in writing, Company shall cease the use of, and cease distribution of any Applications containing, any part of the Steamworks SDK, and if requested, shall return or certify destruction of all copies of the Steamworks SDK and any Valve Confidential Information.
